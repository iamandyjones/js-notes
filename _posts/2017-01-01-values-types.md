Javascript has typed values, not typed variables

I.e. only values have types, variables are just simple containers for values

There are 6 built in types, 7 as of ES6...

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object
- symbol (new to ES6)

Whilst we also use both array and function types a lot, these aren't actually built-in types, and should be thought of as subtypes - specialised versions of object.
