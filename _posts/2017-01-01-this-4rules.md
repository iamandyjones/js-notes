To determine what "this" refers to, we must inspect the call site and determine which of 4 rules applies...

**DEFAULT BINDING**

The default, catch all binding when no other rules apply. 

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(){

	console.log(this.a);

}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2 (this is the call site)
{% endhighlight %}

foo is called with a plain function reference. Therefore this refers to the global object, and this.a refers to the global object property a, which we can see has the value of 2.

If strict mode was in play, it would not be possible to have default binding with the global object and therefore "this" would be set to undefined.

Importantly, we're talking about strict mode inside the function where "this" is referenced. Strict mode state of the call site of foo() is irrelevant.

**IMPLICIT BINDING**

Does the call site have a context object?

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(){

	console.log(this.a);

}

var obj = {

	a: 2,
	foo: foo

};

obj.foo(); // 2 
{% endhighlight %}

The site of foo on the line above uses the obj context to call the function reference.

It isn't the fact that the "foo" property of obj holds a reference to the foo function that's important...

It's that when the function is called (the call site), the function reference is preceded by the obj context!

The rule of implicit binding defines that when there is an object context in this way, it's that object which should be used for that function calls binding of "this".

Because "this" refers to "obj", this.a is synonomous with obj.a

Only the top/last level of an object property reference chain matters to the call site...

obj1.obj2.foo(); <-- here "this" refers to obj2.

Implicitly Lost refers to when implictly bound functions lose its "this" binding...

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(){

	console.log(this.a);

}

var obj = {

	a: 2,
	foo: foo

};

var bar = obj.foo; // Creates a function reference/alias

var a = "oops global"

bar(); // "oops global"
{% endhighlight %}

Above even though bar appears to be a reference to obj.foo, it's actually just another direct reference to foo() itself.

Moreover, the call site is just a plain, undecorated function call so the default binding applies. 

**EXPLICIT BINDING **

With implicit binding we add a property function reference on an object to bind "this" to the object

With Explicit binding we use .call or .apply (utilities available via a functions' prototype) to force a function to use a particular object for the "this" binding.

Both .call and .apply take an aobject to use for "this" as their first argument, and with respect to the binding of "this" are identical. 

Because we are directly stating what object to use for "this", it's called EXPLICIT binding.

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(){
	console.log(this.a);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo.call(obj); // 2
{% endhighlight %}

Above, the foo function is called with its "this" reference explicitly set to obj.

"Hard binding" is a variation of this pattern which aims to prevent a function losing its intended "this" reference...

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(){
	console.log(this.a);
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

var bar = function(){
	foo.call(obj);
}

bar(); // 2
setTimeout(bar, 100); // 2
bar.call(window); // 2
{% endhighlight %}

No matter how bar is invoked, it will always call foo with "this" bound to "obj".

This binding is explicit and strong, called "hard binding".

**new BINDING**

In traditon class-oriented languages, "constructors" are special methods attached to classes, that when the class is instantiated with a "new" operator, the constructor of that class is called. E.g.

{% highlight javascript %}
something = new MyClass(..);
{% endhighlight %}

HOWEVER in JS, although there is a new operator, and the code pattern to use it is basically the same, there is no connection to class-oriented functionality implied by "new" usage in JS>

In JS "constructors" are just regular functions that have been called with the "new" operator in front of them.

They are not attached to classes, nor are they instantiating a class.

When any function is called with the "new" operator, that function call is known as a "constructor call". 

NB really there is no such thing as "constructor functions", there is just "constructor function calls".

**When a function is invokved with "new" in front of it, it does 4 things...**

1. a brand new object is created (constructed) out of thin air
2. the newly constructed object is prototype linked
3. the newly created object is set as the this binding for that function call
4. unless the function returns its own object, the newly constructed object is automatically returned

{% highlight javascript %}
function foo(a){

	// this relates to the new empty object created
	// by use of the "new" operator below.
	// the new object is automatically returned by this function

	this.a = a;

} 

var bar = new foo(2); 
// Use of "new" operator sets context of "this" to a new empty object.

console.log(bar.a);
// 2 <-- because the foo function was invoked with "new" operator,
// it automatically returns the new object which now has a property
// of a set to the argument passed in.
{% endhighlight %}
