Variable names, including function names, mut be valid identifiers.

An identifier must start with a-z, A-Z, $, or _

It can then contain any of those characters plus the numerals 0-9

Generally the same rules apply to property names, however whilst certain words cannot be used as variables, but can be used as property names.

These words are called reserved words and include:

{% highlight javascript %}
for
in
if
null
true
false
// ...etc
{% endhighlight %}
